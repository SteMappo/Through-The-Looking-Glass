        					<p>SkyChess is a business simulation game that can be run over two, three or four days in which participants must manage their own airline... and survive. SkyChess is packed with opportunities to try out real operational and strategic decision-making.</p>

        				<p>It is powered by up-to-date software. The game includes a mix of operational as well as strategic decision making in a competitive airline environment. It is team-oriented, addictive, fun to play, but with serious learning objectives. Participants play in teams of about 7 persons each. Teams must make decisions for a fictional airline, and each set of decisions is valid for a period of three months. The teams must analyse their results for each quarterly period and then submit a further set of decisions, and so on. A game with 8 sets of decisions would represent 'two years'.</p>
